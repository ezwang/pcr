                      Each professor or course has its own page.

                      The site includes new features intended to make PCR's content more intuitive and accessible. The new search function allows students to search by course name, number, or professor. In addition to the traditional ratings, the site now offers ratings that average the evaluations from every semester the course or professor has been reviewed. Students can choose which information is relevant to them by selecting which rating criteria appear on the page.

                      At the end of each semester, the Provost's office, in conjunction with ISC, administers Penn's course evaluation form, which consists of eleven questions aimed at assessing the quality of the course and instructor. Each evaluation question is answered on a scale of Poor to Excellent. The ratings are translated numerically so that a rating of 0.00 corresponds a student evaluation of "Poor," 1.00 corresponds to an evaluation of "Fair," 2.00 to "Good," 3.00 to "Very Good," and 4.00 to "Excellent."
