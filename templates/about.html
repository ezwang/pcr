  <h1>About</h1>

  <p>Penn Course Review is a student-run service that provides numerical ratings for undergraduate courses and professors at the University of Pennsylvania. PCR has a long history of being a valuable and influential guide for course selection.</p>
  <p>PCR is developed and managed by <a href="http://pennlabs.org/">Penn Labs</a>, a student developer organization on Pennâ€™s campus.</p>

  <p>The Penn Course Review compiles its information from online course evaluations conducted at the end of each semester by the Provost's office in conjunction with ISC.</p>
  <p>Your evaluations and comments feed the Review, so the more information you provide about your courses and professors, the more comprehensive Penn Course Review will be.</p>

  <p>If you want to look at courses on the go, <a href="http://pennlabs.org/mobile/">PennMobile</a> is available for download! In the courses section, you are able to view course descriptions and ratings!</p>
  <p>Thanks and happy searching,</p>
