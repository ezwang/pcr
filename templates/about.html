    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>Penn Course Review is a student-run service that provides numerical ratings for undergraduate courses and professors at the University of Pennsylvania. PCR has a long history of being a valuable and influential guide for course selection.</p>
    <p>PCR is developed and managed by <a href="http://pennlabs.org/">Penn Labs</a>, a student developer organization on Pennâ€™s campus.</p>

    <p>The Penn Course Review compiles its information from online course evaluations conducted at the end of each semester by the Provost's office in conjunction with ISC.</p>
    <p>Your evaluations and comments feed the Review, so the more information you provide about your courses and professors, the more comprehensive Penn Course Review will be.</p>
