PennCourseReview
================================================================================

PennCourseReview is a student-run publication that provides numerical ratings
and written reviews for undergraduate courses taught at the University of
Pennsylvania. PCR has a long history of being a valuable and influential guide
for course selection and is currently leading an effort to increase the number
of written course reviews offered.

The PennCourseReview compiles its information from online course evaluations
conducted at the end of each semester by the Provost's office in conjunction
with ISC.
